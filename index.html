            <p class="text">In an extraordinary twist of fate, Sir Josh found himself at the forefront of a potential crisis 
                when his genius security measures unexpectedly thwarted a hacker attack. As the attacker fully attacked the company's main server, 
                the virus began to spread until Sir Josh calmly intervened, counter attacking the virus by a secret code only known to him.</p>
            <p class="text">The hackers, encountering unforeseen technological barriers, struggled to breach Sir Josh encrypted code. Frustrated and bewildered, 
                they eventually surrendered to reassess their attack strategy, leaving the company servers safe and amazed at Sir Josh resourcefulness.</p>
